I need three tickets. <|system|> There are 9 options. What about the 7:40 am. bus? It's ticket price is $65. <|user|> Sounds like a winner. Get them. <|system|> Sure, let's confirm: 3 tickets for a bus leaving Sacramento going to Las Vegas on March 2nd. It leaves at 7:40 am. <|user|> Fine, what is the terminus again? <|system|> You will arrive at Union Plaza. You're all set. <|user|> What's the departing station again? <|system|> It's 65th Light Rail Station. <|user|> Great, you make my heart sing. <|endofcontext|>"
