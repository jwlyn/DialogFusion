I'd like to make an appointment to see it. <|system|> When should I make the appointment for? <|user|> Make it for the 9th of March. <|system|> To confirm: You would like to see the property on Fremont Boulevard on March 9th. <|user|> No, make it the 2nd of this month instead. <|system|> To confirm: you would like an appointment to see the property on Fremont Boulevard on March 2nd. <|user|> You got it. <|system|> Your appointment is confirmed. <|user|> That's great. Thank you. <|system|> Is there anything else you needed? <|user|> Not right now, thanks. <|endofcontext|>"

Let me see if I got everything correctly: You'd like to book a visit to Avenel Apartments on March 2nd. Is that correct? <|user|> You got that right. Could you find out the property's phone number? Also find out whether it has laundry machines inside the house. <|system|> I have successfully booked your appointment. You can contact the property on 408-844-4803. There are no machines inside the house. <|user|> Thank you very much. You've been very helpful. That will be all. <|endofcontext|>"
