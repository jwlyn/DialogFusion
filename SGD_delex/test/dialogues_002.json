Also is there a particular type of event you would prefer? <|user|> I really like Music events, and something in Portland would be best. <|system|> Bastille is a very popular event taking place at the Theater of The Clouds on March 10th at 5:30 pm. <|user|> I've heard of them, but can you find me something on next Tuesday? Something in New York would be best. <|system|> I've found 10 events which meet your criteria. How about Abbi Jacobson at the Kaufmann Concert Hall on March 5th at 5 pm? <|user|> Maybe. How much is a ticket? <|system|> Tickets cost $40 each. <|user|> Yea, that will work for me. <|endofcontext|>"
