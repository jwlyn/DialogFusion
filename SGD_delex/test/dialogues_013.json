More specifically I am interested for something around Philadelphia. <|system|> Is there a kind of event you particularly prefer? <|user|> I usually enjoy Concert events. <|system|> There are 10 events which match what you requested. One of the events which is a popular one is Anthony Green which will be happening at The Foundry on March 10th at 6 pm. <|user|> That seems nice. I just recalled that I need to request a payment. I will be having the transaction with Bob, and it will be for 23 bucks, also I want for the transfer to be private. <|system|> Can you please confirm that you want to make a private transaction with Bob for the amount of $23? <|user|> Yes, that is correct. <|system|> Your request for payment has been done. <|user|> I appreciate it! Now let's get back to buying tickets for the event you found earlier, for which I need to have 3 tickets. <|system|> Can you please confirm that you want to buy 3 tickets for the Anthony Green event which will happen in Philadelphia on March 10th? <|user|> Yes, that is right. <|system|> Your requested tickets have been booked. Enjoy your time at the event. <|user|> I am grateful for your help. That would be all. <|endofcontext|>"

Usually I enjoy Concert events, though the event should be happening this Sunday. <|system|> Is there some specific city I should look for the event? <|user|> I will be around LA so please have a look there. <|system|> There is the Aldous Harding event which is quite popular, and it will happen at Lodge Room on March 3rd at 6 pm. <|user|> This one seems nice. Is there some other events which you can recommend? <|system|> Altin Gun is also another popular event which will be happening at The Teragram Ballroom on March 3rd at 4:30 pm. <|user|> This one seems quite good. <|system|> Is there something else I can help you with today? <|user|> I also want to find a hotel in that area. <|system|> I have a found a 3 star hotel which is called Ac Hotel By Marriott Beverly Hills. <|user|> Can you give me the address of the hotel, and their phone number I can use to call them? <|system|> The hotel is found at 6399 Wilshire Boulevard, and if you want to get in touch with them you can at +1 323-852-7000 <|user|> That seems nice. Now I would like to buy 1 ticket for the event you found earlier. <|system|> Can you please confirm that you want to buy 1 ticket for the Altin Gun event which happens in Los Angeles on March 3rd? <|user|> That is not right, because I want to have four tickets. <|system|> Could you please confirm that you want to buy 4 tickets for the Altin Gun event? <|user|> Yes, that suits me well. <|system|> Your requested booking has been made. Enjoy your time there! <|user|> Can you tell me the price of the ticket, and the address of the venue? <|system|> The ticket has a price of $45, and the venue can be found at 1234 West 7th Street. <|user|> I appreciate your help very much. That would be all. <|endofcontext|>"

Though now I am interested in finding something to do there on 14th of March somewhere in NYC, and more specifically I enjoy Musical performance. <|system|> There are 10 events which you might consider. One of the events which is quite popular is Alma Deutscher. This event will be happening at Stern Auditorium / Perelman Stage on March 14th at 7 pm. <|user|> That seems as a nice one. <|system|> Are you willing to have tickets bought for this event? <|user|> Not willing to do that at the moment. That would be all. <|endofcontext|>"
