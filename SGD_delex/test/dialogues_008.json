To confirm, you'd like to make a private transaction request with Wilson for $42, is that right? <|user|> Yes, that's right. <|system|> Ok, your payment request has been made. <|user|> Great, thanks. I'd also like to make a payment. <|system|> Sure, with whom? <|user|> This transaction is with Yumi. <|system|> Ok, how much is the payment for and should I transfer the funds from the app balance or your debit card? <|user|> It's for $155, and you can transfer it from my JCB. <|system|> Sure. To confirm, you'd like to transfer $155 to Yumi using your credit card via public transaction. <|user|> Yes, that's fine. <|system|> Ok, your payment has been made and the recipient should see it in their account shortly. <|user|> Great, thanks for your help! That's all for now. <|endofcontext|>"

Can you book the tickets for me? <|system|> Certainly. Would you like travel insurance? <|user|> Yes I would. Also I would like the value tickets. <|system|> You would like 2 value tickets for a train from Vancouver to Seattle on March 7th at 6:40 am. Is that correct? <|user|> No, I changed my mind.
