I'll need a unit with at least 2 baths. <|system|> How many bed rooms would you like the apartment to have? <|user|> 2 bedrooms as well. <|system|> I've found an apartment I think you'd like. It's located in the Alameda Gardens Apartments at 73 North Keeble Avenue. The unit has 2 bed rooms, as well as 2 baths, and costs $3,150 per month. <|user|> I've heard that place has a lot of bums hanging around outside. Can you find me something else in the area? <|system|> Sure, how about the Almaden Lake Apartments at 978 Almaden Lake Drive. It also has 2 bed rooms and 2 baths, and the rent is $3,100 per month. <|user|> That sounds nice. Does the apartment come furnished? <|system|> Unfortunately the apartment does not come furnished. <|user|> Okay, what's the contact phone number? <|system|> The property's contact number is 408-323-8020. <|user|> Yes, I like everything about it so far. Can you schedule a visit to the apartment for me? The 6th of this month would work best. <|system|> You would like to schedule a visit to Almaden Lake Apartments next Wednesday. Is this correct? <|user|> Yes that is all correct. Also, can you tell me if pets are allowed? <|system|> I am glad to inform you that you visit has successfully been scheduled, and the apartment allows pets. <|user|> Great, thanks a bunch. <|system|> No problem, is there anything else that I could assist you with? <|user|> No, that will be all for now. <|endofcontext|>"

I'd like to reserve a table. <|system|> What time would you like me to make the reservation? <|user|> I'd like to go at 8 in the night. <|system|> Sure no problem. So just to confirm: You would like to book a table for 2 people at Pezzella's Villa Napoli in Sunnyvale today at 8 pm. <|user|> Actually no, I'd like to change the date to the 13th of this month and I only need a reservation for 1. <|system|> So that's March 13th for 1 person. <|user|> I've changed my mind again. Please make the reservation for morning 11:45 for three people. <|system|> So that's a reservation at 11:45 am for 3 people. <|user|> Perfect. What is the customer rating for the restaurant and do they have outdoor seating? <|system|> Unfortunately I have been unable to make a reservation. The restaurant does have outdoor seating and customers have given Pezzella's Villa Napoli restaurant a rating of 4.3. Would you like me to book a table for March 13th at 12 pm instead? <|user|> Sure that's fine. <|system|> Your reservation has been successful. <|user|> Thanks <|system|> Do you need help with anything else? <|user|> No thanks <|endofcontext|>"

Can you find me some reasonably priced restaurants in San Jose? <|system|> How about Ariake? It has some inexpensive food, and is located at San Jose. <|user|> That sounds good. <|system|> Would you like to reserve a table at Ariake? <|user|> Yes I do. <|system|> What time would you like? <|user|> I'd like to reserve a table for 1 at morning 11:30. <|system|> Okay. So, I should book you a table for 1 at Ariake in San Jose, at 11:30 am today? <|user|> Actually, I need some extra time to prepare, and a few of my friends want to come along. Can you instead make the reservation at 1:15 pm for 3 people? <|system|> Okay. You would rather book at table for 3 at 1:15 pm? <|user|> Yes. What's the user rating of the restaurant? Can I have their meals outdoors if I so desire? <|system|> I'm so sorry! I couldn't reserve your table. As for your questions, the users rank it highly, with an average of 4.0. Outdoor seating is unavailable. Now then, would you be okay with me instead booking your table for 3 at Ariake on today at 1:30 pm? <|user|> Yes, that would be fine. <|system|> I have successfully reserved your table. <|user|> Great! Many thanks. <|system|> Can I do anything else for you? <|user|> Nope! That'll be all. Thanks. <|endofcontext|>"
