There is one available at Santa Fe Depot for collection next Thursday. This is an Accord which is a standard car. <|user|> What about other options? I'd like to collect a standard car from Mexico city instead. <|system|> I have found a standard car available at Estacion Buenavista next Thursday. The car is a Camry. <|user|> That's great. Please can I book this car. <|system|> Sure, so for confirmation: You would like to collect a standard car from Estacion Buenavista next Thursday at 3:30 pm and you be returning the car on March 11th. <|user|> Perfect. How much will the car cost? <|endofcontext|>"

Please find out whether there are other buses going to Vegas. <|system|> Okay, no problem. I found a bus that costs $34, and it departs at 12:30 pm and has 0 transfers. <|user|> That won't work for me. Please search for more options. <|system|> How about the $41 bus with 0 transfers, leaving at 2:50 pm? <|user|> Please confirm the origin and destination stations. <|system|> You'll be leaving from Anaheim Intermodal Center station and arriving at Union Plaza station <|user|> That works for me. Please reserve the bus. <|system|> Please confirm that you'd like to purchase tickets for 3 people travelling on the Anaheim to Las Vegas bus which leaves the day after tomorrow, at 2:50 pm. <|user|> Yes, that's correct. <|system|> I have confirmed your ticket. <|user|> Thank you very much. You've been very helpful. <|system|> Would you like help with anything else? <|user|> No, Thank you very much for your help. <|endofcontext|>"

One of them leaves at 7:40 am and has 0 transfers. Its ticket is $24. <|user|> $24 is a bit more expensive than I thought. Can you find me a cheaper bus? I need tickets for 4 people. <|system|> There is another bus which costs just $19. It leaves at 8 am and also has 0 transfers. <|user|> Which station does this bus leave from? And which station does it go to? <|system|> It goes from Port Authority Station to the Intercity Terminal. <|user|> Actually, I don't think we all need to go together. I'll go on March 9th instead. Can you find me a bus for 2 which leaves then? <|system|> Sure. There are 5 such buses. One leaves at 11:30 am. Its ticket is $21 and its route has 0 transfers. <|user|> That's perfect. <|system|> Should I purchase your tickets now? <|user|> Nah, I'm still not sure when I'm going and with how many people, so I don't need the tickets now.

How about this bus that leaves at 10:10 am with 0 transfers for $22? <|user|> Are there any other buses leaving from SFO and going to Sacramento? <|system|> There are 10. How about this bus that departs at 7:20 am with 0 transfers for $21? <|user|> That sounds good. <|system|> Are you ready to purchase tickets now? <|user|> Yes I would like to reserve a ticket for 1 person. <|system|> Ok, I have 1 ticket for the bus that departs at 7:20 am from San Francisco going to Sacramento on March 13th for $21? Is that correct? <|user|> Yes, that is correct. <|system|> Your ticket is confirmed. <|user|> Thanks for your help. That is all I need for now. <|endofcontext|>"
