I want to have another option. <|system|> United Airlines might appeal to you. Its flight takes off at 7:50 pm, it has 0 layovers, and a ticket will cost you $120. <|user|> 7:50 pm is kind of late.

Also has 1 layover that costs $301 and leaves at 7:10 pm <|user|> Where does it land? And is this ok for two passengers? <|system|> This is just for 1 passenger, and it's headed to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport <|user|> Find me an economy class ticket instead <|system|> I found 2 flights that work. How about Southwest airlines with 1 layover and a 6:25 am departure for $298 <|user|> Yes that works, but find me a round trip flight <|system|> When do you want to return? <|user|> I'm coming back next Tuesday <|system|> I found 1 flight that works via Southwest Airlines and leaves at 6:25 am local time. The return flight leaves at 3:05 pm and will cost $592 per head. <|user|> All right then <|system|> Can I help with anything else? <|user|> No, that's it thanks <|endofcontext|>"
