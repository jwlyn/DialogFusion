I'm fine with sharing a ride. <|system|> Please confirm the details for the ride: You want a cab for 2 people to go to 200 Greenbriar Circle and you're okay with a shared ride. <|user|> No, it's only for 1 person and I need to go to Chilpancingo Vista Apartments. <|system|> So you want a cab for 1 person to take you to Chilpancingo Vista Apartments, right? <|user|> Yup, that's right. <|system|> Okay, the rides booked and a cab will be there shortly. <|user|> How long will the ride be and how much does it cost? <|system|> It'll take about 24 minutes and cost $14.99. <|user|> Great, thanks a lot! <|system|> Is there anything else I can do for you? <|user|> No, thanks.
