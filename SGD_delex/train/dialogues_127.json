Tell me the movie that you would like to go watch. <|user|> I would like to see Dumbo and prefer movies in Santa Clara. I want to go view it on March 1st. <|system|> I was able to find 1 showtime for the movie at 10 pm in ShowPlace ICON Valley Fair. <|user|> What is the price of the ticket? <|system|> Each ticket cost $20. <|user|> What is the movie genre? Can you give me the theater's address? <|system|> The movie is a fantasy and the theater is located at 2855 Stevens Creek Boulevard Suite 2160. <|user|> That sounds pretty appealing. <|system|> Do you want me to purchase some tickets for you? <|user|> Naw, I don't want to buy any at this time. <|system|> Would you like help with something else? <|user|> Can you grab a cab for me? <|system|> What is your desired ride type and how many seats? <|user|> I would ideally like a pool ride. There's only 1. <|system|> Please verify the following specifics: You need 1 seat for a pool ride that is going to 2855 Stevens Creek Boulevard Suite 2160. <|user|> Yep, that is correct. <|system|> I have booked the cab and it's headed to you now. <|user|> I thank you for all your help and that's it. <|endofcontext|>"
