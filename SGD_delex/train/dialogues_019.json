Which airport you want to choose for your departure? <|user|> I would like to fly on 5th of this month from SFO airport and have to reach Los Angeles. <|system|> Sure, I can help you make your reservation. The Alaska Airlines flight having its outbound leaving time at 8:20 pm flies to Los Angeles and return flight timing would be at 5:50 pm. Including tax, the cost of your travel would add to $111. Can I book with this flight? <|user|> That's fine. Sounds good. <|system|> Economy, Business class or first class ticket you want to purchase? <|user|> Nope, not now. <|system|> That's Okay!
