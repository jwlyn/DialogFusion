It's a beautiful hotel with a 4 star rating. <|user|> I'd like to hear about some other options. <|system|> If you are interested in a 5 star hotel, I recommend 1 Hotel Central Park. <|user|> That sounds expensive. What else is available? <|system|> I see 11 Howard is available. It is a 3 star hotel. <|user|> What is the contact number and how much are the rooms per night? <|system|> Rooms start at $168 per night and the phone number is +1 212-235-1111. <|user|> That's more in my budget. I like that one. <|system|> Do you want me to make a reservation for you? <|user|> Yes, I'd like to reserve the room. <|system|> When will you be arriving and how long is your stay? <|user|> I'd like to check in on the 6th of this month and stay for 2 days. <|system|> Let me make sure I've got this right. You'd like to reserve 1 room at 11 Howard in New York beginning next Wednesday for 2 days. Is that correct? <|user|> Yes, that's right. Can you tell me the address? <|system|> The address is 11 Howard Street. Your room has successfully been booked. <|user|> Great! That's everything I need. Thank you for your help. <|endofcontext|>"
