I need to transfer some money. Can you send funds to Xiaoxue's savings account? <|system|> Sure! How much do you want to transfer? <|user|> $30. Also, make it their checking account instead. <|system|> Okay. Just to confirm, you would like to transfer $30 from your checking account to Xiaoxue's checking account. Is that right? <|user|> Yep! <|system|> Great! Your transfer is complete. <|user|> Thanks! Can you tell me my new balance? <|system|> Sure! You have $6,782.68 in your checking account. <|user|> Alright, that sounds good. <|system|> Is there anything else I can help you with? <|user|> Nope, that was all. Thanks for your help! <|endofcontext|>"
