Three tickets for something on the 6th of March. <|system|> Ok. Is there a specific event I should be looking for? <|user|> Yes. It's Russian Circles. <|system|> Ok. So to confirm, you want me to reserve 3 tickers for Russian Circles, next Wednesday in New York? <|user|> No, It needs to be near Seattle, WA. <|system|> Ok. So the reservations need to be for next Wednesday in Seattle. <|user|> No, I want it for the 10th. <|system|> Alright. I'll look for reservations for March 10th in Seattle. <|user|> Yep, that's right. <|system|> I'm sorry, I couldn't reserve any tickets for you. Is there anything else I can do for you? <|user|> Can you change that to two tickets and try again? <|system|> Sure. So we're going to try to reserve 2 tickets for Russian Circles in Seattle on March 10th? <|user|> Yes. Where is the venue & what time does it start? <|system|> I'm sorry, it looks like I still can't reserve any tickets for you. Is there anything else I can help with? <|user|> No, that's it. Thanks. <|endofcontext|>"
