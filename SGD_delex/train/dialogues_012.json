What else is showing? <|system|> Other movies showing in San Jose are Captain Marvel, Dogman, and Dumbo. <|user|> Nah, those aren't what I'm looking for. What imax shows are out? <|system|> There are 4 shows that are shown in imax theaters. Some are Hellboy, Long Shot, and Mary Magdalene. Would you like to see any of those? <|user|> Yes, Long Shot would actually be perfect. I forgot that was out. What time is it showing? <|system|> I can find the time for you. What date are planning to go? <|user|> Oh, sorry. I would like to see it on the 9th of March. <|system|> Alright, the movie is showing 1 time that day at the AMC Eastridge 15 theater at 10 pm. <|user|> That will work for me. <|system|> Would you like to reserve tickets now? <|user|> No, I will have to get the tickets later. I might have to do something with my brother that day. <|system|> Do you need anything else today? <|user|> No, that's all I need. Thanks for your help! <|endofcontext|>"

Alright, what's the address of the theater? <|system|> The theater is located at 474 24th Street. <|user|> Okay, yeah, that sounds alright. <|system|> Do you want to get tickets today? <|user|> Not right now thanks, I don't think I need anything else. <|endofcontext|>"
