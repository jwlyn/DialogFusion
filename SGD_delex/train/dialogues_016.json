I will need to book 3 tickets. My wife and son are coming with me. <|system|> Ok what date are you planning on flying? Also, I will need to know your destination. <|user|> We are flying Atlanta, GA on the 4th. <|system|> There is an American Airlines flight 8:40 pm with 0 stops that costs $108. Will that work for you? <|user|> I don't know. Is that a redeye flight? <|system|> No, it is not an overnight flight. <|user|> Which airport will that flight be departing from? <|system|> It takes off from O'Hare International Airport. <|user|> Can you find something else. I'm just wondering if there is something that will work out better for us. <|system|> Sure there is a Delta Airlines flight that leaves 8:30 am with 0 stops. This flight costs $100. <|user|> Maybe, are there any other flights. I want Economy class tickets. Is there anything leaving from San Fran. <|system|> OK, there is an Alaska Airlines flight that leaves at 1:35 pm with 1 stop. This flight will cost $252 per ticket. <|user|> OK, that one will work. <|system|> Is there anything else I can help you with? <|user|> No, that is all. Thanks for your help. <|endofcontext|>"

Is that right? <|user|> Not quite. I'm actually going to be leaving from Paris on that day. And I'll have friends with me, so I actually need three tickets. <|system|> Okay! So you will be departing from Paris and need 3 tickets for your group. Did I get it right this time? <|user|> Yep! Thanks for working with me. How much will the tickets cost? Also, what is the name of the airport we'll arrive at? <|system|> Actually, I wasn't able to book a ticket. I think all the tickets out of Paris are booked that day. Sorry about that. Is there anything else I can help you with? <|user|> No, that was all. Thanks for trying. <|endofcontext|>"
