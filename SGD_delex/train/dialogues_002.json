He goes back to his hometown and tries to get his life back on track, but things don't work out the way he thought they would. He ends up spending the rest of his life in a mental institution. The movie is based on the true story of George Sidney, a man who went to Vegas to meet a woman and ended up spending his life there. He ended up in the mental institution because he couldn't get out of his own head. He was in a state of mind where he didn't know what he wanted to do with his life. He thought he was going to be a rock star or a movie star, but instead he ended up as a mental patient. He had a lot of problems with his mental illness, but he was able to get the help he needed to get himself out of the situation he was in.
