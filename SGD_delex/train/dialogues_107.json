How about Family? <|user|> Family is a good choice. <|system|> Do you want me to start playing that film? <|user|> No, not at the moment. <|system|> Is there anything else you need? <|user|> Help me find some songs too. <|system|> Are you familiar with Gotta Be A Reason by Alec Benjamin? It came out on the album Narrated For You. <|user|> Yea, let's go with that. <|system|> Do you want to play the song now? <|user|> Yes, please. <|system|> To confirm, you want to play the song Gotta Be A Reason on the TV? <|user|> No, bring it up on the kitchen device instead. <|system|> Okay. So, you want to start playing Gotta Be A Reason on the Kitchen speaker? <|user|> Actually, no, let's use the Bedroom speaker. <|system|> Sure. To be clear, I should play Gotta Be A Reason on the Bedroom speaker? <|user|> That's right. <|system|> Enjoy the song! <|user|> What genre of music is this? Did it come out in '14? <|system|> This is a Pop song from the year 2018. <|user|> Thanks. <|system|> Is there anything else you need right now? <|user|> No, I'm fine. Thanks. <|endofcontext|>"

Can you give me the phone number which I can use to call them? Can you also check if they have music there? <|system|> Your table has been booked. Unfortunately there is no live music there.

I'll be in Berkeley, so anything in that area will be great. <|system|> Is there a restaurant that you prefer? <|user|> I've been to Addis before and it was really good. If they have any availability, that would work. <|system|> Ok, can you please confirm a reservation for 2 at Addis Restaurant in Berkeley on March 6th at 5:15 pm. <|user|> That sounds correct. It's fine either way, but do they serve alcohol? <|system|> The good news is the reservation is successful, the bad news, they don't serve alcohol. <|user|> That's fine.
