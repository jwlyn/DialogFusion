Which city would you like me to search, and for what time will you be making the reservation? Is there a preferred restaurant or type of food you prefer? <|user|> We want to eat at the Claw Shack in San Jose. Please make the reservation for 11:30 am. <|system|> Please confirm that you would like to book a 11:30 am reservation for today at the Claw Shack in San Jose for a party of 2. <|user|> I'd prefer to eat at the 3rd Cousin, and the reservation will need to be for four people. <|system|> Please confirm you'd like me to book a table for 4 people at the 3rd Cousin. <|user|> Yes, that would be very helpful. <|system|> Sorry, but there are no reservations for that time. May I help you with something else? <|user|> No, but thank you. <|endofcontext|>"
