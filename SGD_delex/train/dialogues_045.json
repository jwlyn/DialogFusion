I'd like to make a reservation for 2 people this Saturday. <|system|> For what time did you want to make the reservation? <|user|> I'd like to make it at quarter to 7 in the evening. <|system|> Please confirm you're booking a table for 2 at Brix Restaurant and Gardens in Napa on March 2nd at 6:45 pm. <|user|> That sounds good. What is the address and does the restaurant have live music? <|system|> The address is 7377 Saint Helena Highway and they do not have live music. Sorry, I could not make a reservation. Should I try another reservation for 2 people at Brix Restaurant and Gardens on March 2nd at 7 pm? <|user|> No, thank you. <|system|> Did you need help with anything else? <|user|> No, but thank you. <|endofcontext|>"
