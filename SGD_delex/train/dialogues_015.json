It will be two tickets. <|system|> Do you know which event you want to see? <|user|> People have been saying Allan Rayman puts on a good show. <|system|> I found an event with Allan Rayman. I can get 2 tickets in San Francisco on March 9th. Does that sound good? <|user|> No, never mind that. I also know that the Thee Oh Sees are pretty good. Can you get four tickets to that? <|system|> Let me make sure. Do you want 4 tickets to Thee Oh Sees? <|user|> Yes, please. That would be perfect. <|system|> Your tickets are reserved. <|user|> Awesome! Thanks. That's all. <|endofcontext|>"

Can you tell me where you'll be flying from and where you'll be flying to? Also, what date would you like to travel? <|user|> I am looking for flights from San Francisco to Las Vegas and I would like to leave on the 8th of March. <|system|> Okay, I've found 4 possible flights for you. Would you be interested in flying with Alaska Airlines? The flight departs at 8:15 pm and has 0 stops. The cost is $103. <|user|> And where will the flight arrive? <|system|> It will land at McCarran International Airport. <|user|> I don't know if that will work. Can you tell me some other options? <|system|> There's also a flight on American Airlines for $102. It departs at 5:30 pm and has 0 stops. <|user|> No, I'll need a different itinerary. I also need to buy a total of 4 tickets. <|system|> No problem. There's another flight aboard Delta Airlines that departs at 10:50 am. It costs $105 and has 0 stops. <|user|> That might work. Can you tell me if this is a Premium Economy ticket? <|system|> It is actually in Economy class. <|user|> Okay, thank you for the information. That's all for now. <|endofcontext|>"

I will be flying on the March 14th. <|system|> I can see that 4 flights suit what you want. Would you prefer to have American Airlines as your airline? The flight will be departing at 9:15 pm and it has 0 stops. The flight will be costing you $128. <|user|> Can you tell me if this is a redeye flight? <|system|> I can confirm that it is not an overnight trip. <|user|> Alright, seems fine. <|system|> Is there something else I can help you with? <|user|> No, that would be all. I appreciate your help. <|endofcontext|>"
