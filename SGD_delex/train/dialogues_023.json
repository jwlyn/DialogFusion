Until what date will you need this car? <|user|> I need a car that will be available through March 5th. <|system|> Okay. When and where would you like to pick it up? <|user|> I would like to pick it up from Ciudad de Mexico on this Sunday. <|system|> Great. One more question: what time would you like to pick it up? <|user|> I would prefer to pick it up around 1:30 in the afternoon. <|system|> Thanks! There are 6 cars that meet your requirements. How about a Camry, which is a standard car? It's available at Estacion Buenavista for pickup on the day after tomorrow. <|user|> I'm not thrilled with that option. What else could I rent? <|system|> There's a Civic available, which is also considered a standard car. It's available at Estacion Buenavista for pickup on the day after tomorrow as well. <|user|> I would really prefer a medium-sized car. Are there any available? <|system|> Yes, I have a Corolla available at Benito Juarez International Airport for pickup on the day after tomorrow. That's also considered a standard car. <|user|> What's the total cost to reserve that car? <|endofcontext|>"

Until what date will you need this car? <|user|> I need a car that will be available through March 5th. <|system|> Okay. When and where would you like to pick it up? <|user|> I would like to pick it up from Ciudad de Mexico on this Sunday. <|system|> Great. One more question: what time would you like to pick it up? <|user|> I would prefer to pick it up around 1:30 in the afternoon. <|system|> Thanks! There are 6 cars that meet your requirements. How about a Camry, which is a standard car? It's available at Estacion Buenavista for pickup on the day after tomorrow. <|user|> I'm not thrilled with that option. What else could I rent? <|system|> There's a Civic available, which is also considered a standard car. It's available at Estacion Buenavista for pickup on the day after tomorrow as well. <|user|> I would really prefer a medium-sized car. Are there any available? <|system|> Yes, I have a Corolla available at Benito Juarez International Airport for pickup on the day after tomorrow. That's also considered a standard car. <|user|> What's the total cost to reserve that car? <|system|> That reservation will total $56. <|user|> That sounds good. Would you please reserve that car? <|system|> Certainly. Please confirm: you are reserving a standard car for pickup from Benito Juarez International Airport on the day after tomorrow at 1:30 pm. You'll return it next Tuesday. <|user|> Yes, that's perfect. <|system|> I've reserved your car. <|user|> Thanks for your help! <|system|> Is there anything else I can do for you today? <|user|> No, that's it. Thanks again. <|endofcontext|>"
